This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
system('wget ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_mouse/release_M22/gencode.vM22.pc_transcripts.fa.gz; zgrep "^>" gencode.vM22.pc_transcripts.fa.gz > gencode.vM22.pc_transcripts.txt')
tx <- read_tsv('gencode.vM22.pc_transcripts.txt', col_names = FALSE)
tx <- tx %>% rowwise() %>% mutate(gene = str_split(X1, '\\|')[[1]][6],
                    id = str_split(X1, '\\|')[[1]][2]) %>% 
  select(gene, id) %>% unique()
tx %>% filter(gene == 'Crx')
```

```{r}
FeaturePlot(integrated, tx %>% filter(gene == 'Crx') %>% pull(id))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
