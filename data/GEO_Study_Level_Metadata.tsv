GSE121707	SRP166660	Müller glial cells (MGs) of the zebrafish retina exhibit the remarkable ability to reprogram to proliferative, retinal progenitor-like cells that can regenerate lost photoreceptors and restore vision. Unfortunately, mammalian MGs are not regenerative and this is at least in part due to the inability of MGs to undergo sustained cell cycle re-entry in response to retinal damage. Here, we identify the Hippo pathway as the core regulatory mechanism that normally prevents mammalian MG reprogramming to a proliferative, progenitor-like state. Specifically, in adult MGs within the damaged retina, Hippo signaling represses the activity of the transcription cofactor YAP, which would otherwise promote sustained MG cell cycle re-entry. MG-specific deletion of Hippo pathway components Lats1 and Lats2 resulted in Cyclin D1 upregulation and spontaneous MG proliferation. These data suggest that sustained YAP activity in reactive MGs induces MG proliferation and reprogramming, but this response is normally repressed by the Hippo pathway. Generation of MGs that express a variant of YAP (YAP5SA) that is non-responsive to Hippo signaling, resulted in cellular reprogramming whereby MG identity was lost and the cells acquired a highly proliferative, progenitor-like state.  Together, our results reveal that MGs may have latent regenerative capacity that can be “reawakened” by blocking Hippo signaling.	Adult Glast-CreERT2+/tg; Yap5SA+/tg; R26R-tdTomato+/tg mice were induced with tamoxifen followed by NMDA injection.  After 2 days, tdTomato+ cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) followed by scRNA-seq using the 10X Genomics platform.

GSE118614	SRP158081	Single cell RNA sequencing using either an adapted Smart-seq2 protocol on Chx10-GFP (+) retinal progenitor cells; 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell system across 10 timepoints of mouse retinal development to examine retinal progenitor cell heterogeneity across retinal development and global changes in gene expression from early retinal neuroepithelial cells through specification and differentiation of retinal cell types; 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell on P14 Nfia/b/x het control or Nfia/b/x tCKO (Chx10-Cre-GFP) retinas	Examination of transcript expression within 120,840 cells across 10 developmental time-points (14 experiments) via 10x Genomics and 864 cells via an adapted Smart-Seq2 protocol; Characterization of Nfia/b/x mutant phenotypes using single-cell RNA-seq
GSE130636	SRP194595	Purpose: Single-cell RNA sequencing has revolutionized cell-type specific gene expression analysis. The goals of this study are to compare cell specific gene expression patterns between retinal cell types originating from the fovea and the periphery of human eyes.	mRNA profiles for thousands of cells from foveal and peripheral retinal isolates were generated from three human donor eyes using 10X Genomics Chromium single-cell system followed by sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 4000.
GSE119343	SRP159286	The macula of the retina has a high ratio of cones to rods and is critical for central vision and visual acuity. Here we report the generation, transcriptome profiling, and functional validation of single cells from cone-enriched human retinal organoids differentiated from hESCs.  Single-cell RNA-seq of 8-month retinal organoids identified clusters of cone and rod photoreceptors and confirmed the cone enrichment initially revealed by immunostaining. Collectively, we have established cone-enriched retinal organoids and a reference of transcriptomes that are rich resources for retinal studies.	To globally characterize the transcriptomes during human retinal cell differentiation, we performed single cell RNA sequencing  of 8M retinal organoids.
GSE112507	SRP136739	Death of photoreceptors and/or Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) cells is a common cause of age related and inherited retinal dystrophies, thus their replenishment from renewable stem cell sources is a well sought therapeutic goal. Human pluripotent stem cells provide a useful cell source in view of their limitless self-renewal capacity and potential to differentiate into all key retinal cell types either in isolation or as part of three dimensional retinal organoids. Photoreceptor precursors have been isolated from differentiating human pluripotent stem cells either through application of cell surface markers or fluorescent reporter approaches and shown to share a transcriptional profile akin to foetal photoreceptors. In this study we investigated the transcriptional profile of CRX+ photoreceptor precursors derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) using single cell RNA sequencing and their engraftment capacity in an animal model of retinitis pigmentosa (C3H/rd1). Single cell RNA seq analysis revealed the presence of dominant cell cluster which displayed the hallmarks of early cone photoreceptor expression. When transplanted subretinally into the C3H/rd1 mice, the Crx positive cells settled next to the inner nuclear layer of host retina, matured into cone photoreceptors and made connections with the inner neurones of the host retina. Cellular transfer between the host retina and donor photoreceptors was investigated and shown to be minimal. Together our data provide valuable molecular insights into the transcriptional profile of human pluripotent stem cells derived CRX+ photoreceptor precursors and indicate their usefulness as a source of transplantable cone photoreceptors.	CRX-GFP human ESC line was differentiated to retinal organoids. At day 90 CRX+ and CRX- cells were purified by flow activated cell sorting and subjected to single cell RNA-seq. RNA-seq of bulk CRX+ and CRX- from the same experiment was carried out in parallel.
GSE126783	SRP186407	In many forms of retinal degenerative diseases in human, microglia relocate to and accumulate in the subretinal space. However, the roles of microglia in retinal degeneration are poorly understood. By leveraging single cell RNA-seq, we identified a distinct microglia subtype in the subretinal space. These microglia underwent transcriptional reprogramming characterized by reduced expression of homeostatic checkpoint genes and upregulation of injury-responsive genes. Importantly, this transition is associated with protection of the retinal pigment epithelium from damage caused by disease. Therefore, our data demonstrated microglial heterogeneity in retinal degeneration and may provide important implications for developing new strategies to prevent loss of vision.

GSE118852	SRP158528	Among mammals, only primates including human possess a small central retinal region called the fovea, which mediates high acuity vision. As other mammals lack a fovea, molecular bases of its specialized function and dysfunction in retinal diseases remain poorly understood. By analyzing &gt;165,000 single-cell transcriptomes from macaque fovea and peripheral retina, we identified and molecularly characterized &gt;60 major cell types in each region. A few cell types are unique to each region, and there are also substantial differences in proportions and gene expression between corresponding types in the two areas, some of which can be related to functional differences. Comparison of macaque and mouse retinal taxonomies reveals both similarities and differences between species. Many molecular features of macaque retinal cell types are conserved in two other primates, marmosets and humans, and key human retinal disease-associated genes are expressed in specific macaque cell types	Peripheral samples from four crab-eating macaque are included.

GSE119893	SRP161678	The rapid improvements in single cell sequencing technologies and analyses methods afford greater scope for dissecting organoid cultures composed of multiple cell types and create an opportunity to interrogate these models to understand tissue biology, cellular behaviour and interactions. To this end, retinal organoids generated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were analysed by single cell RNA-Sequencing at three time points of differentiation. Combinatorial data from all time points revealed the presence of nine clusters, five of which corresponded to key retinal cell types, namely retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), cone and rod photoreceptors and Müller glia cells. The remaining four clusters expressed genes typical of mitotic cells, extracellular matrix (ECM) components and those involved in retinal homeostasis. The cell clustering analysis revealed the decreasing presence of mitotic cells and RGCs, formation of a distinct RPE cluster, the emergence of cone and rod photoreceptors from photoreceptor precursors and an increasing number of Müller Glia cells over time. The pseudotime analysis resembled the order of cell birth during retinal development, with the mitotic cluster commencing the trajectory and the large majority of Müller glia being the latest. Together, these data demonstrate the feasibility and potential of single cell RNA-Seq to dissect the inherent complexity of the organoids and the orderly birth of key retinal cell types.	A hESC (H9) cell line harbouring a CRX-GFP reporter was differentiated to retinal organoids 25. Samples were collected at 60, 90 and 200 days, dissociated, partitioned into single cells using the Fluidigm C1 Single-Cell mRNA-Seq HT IFC and processed for scRNA-Seq.
GSE115258	SRP149696	Purpose: the goal of this experiment was to identify differentially expressed genes in Six3 null, Six6 null and Six3;Six6 compound null retinas by RNAsequencing.	Three pairs of retinas from each genotype were analyzed (n=3 biological replicates). One Six6 KO sample was later removed due to high duplication. Six3KO, Six6KO and DKO samples were compared to WT Controls (Six3F/F) using DESeq2, respectively .
GSE119320	SRP159246	The mechanisms underlying specification of neuronal subtypes within the human nervous system are largely unknown. The blue/S, green/M and red/L cones of the retina enable high-acuity daytime and color vision. To determine the mechanism controlling S vs. L/M fates, we studied the differentiation of human retinal organoids. Organoids and retinas have similar distributions, expression profiles, and morphologies of cone subtypes. S cones are specified first, followed by L/M cones, and thyroid hormone signaling controls this temporal switch. Dynamic expression of thyroid hormone-degrading and activating proteins within the retina ensures low signaling early to specify S cones and high signaling late to produce L/M cones. This work establishes organoids as a model for determining mechanisms of human development with promising utility for therapeutics and vision repair.	EP1 iPSC-derived organoids were analyzed at time points ranging from day 10 to day 250 of differentiation. We took samples at day 10 (n=3), day 20 (n=2), day 35 (n=3), day 69 (n=3), day 111 (n=3), day 128 (n=3), day 158 (n=2), day 173 (n=3), day 181 (n=3), day 200 (n=3), and day 250 7 (n=3). RNA from individual organoids was extracted using the Zymo Direct-zol RNA Microprep Kit (Zymo Research) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Individual libraries were prepared for each sample using the Illumina TruSeq stranded mRNA kit and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 with single 200 bp reads.
GSE115404	SRP149898	Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) convey the major output of information collected from the eye to the brain. Thirty subtypes of RGCs have been identified to date. Here, we analyze 6,225 RGCs (average of 5,000 genes per cell) from right and left eyes by single cell RNA-seq and classify them into 40 subtypes using clustering algorithms. We identify additional subtypes and markers, as well as transcription factors predicted to cooperate in specifying RGC subtypes. Zic1, a marker of the right eye-enriched subtype, is validated by immunostaining in situ. Runx1 and Fst, the markers of other subtypes, are validated in purified RGCs by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunostaining. We show the extent of gene expression variability needed for subtype segregation, and we show a hierarchy in diversification from a cell type population to subtypes. Finally, we present a website for comparing the gene expression of RGC subtypes.
