GSE116106	SRP151023	The development of single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has allowed high resolution analysis of cell type diversity and transcriptional networks controlling cell fate specification. To identify the transcriptional networks governing human retinal development, we performed scRNA-Seq over retinal organoid and in vivo retinal development, across 20 timepoints. Using both pseudotemporal and cross-species analyses, we examined the conservation of gene expression across retinal progenitor maturation and specification of all seven major retinal cell types. Furthermore, we examined gene expression differences between developing macula and periphery and between two distinct populations of horizontal cells. We also identify both shared and species-specific patterns of gene expression during human and mouse retinal development. Finally, we identify an unexpected role for ATOH7 expression in regulation of photoreceptor specification during late retinogenesis. These results provide a roadmap to future studies of human retinal development, and may help guide the design of cell-based therapies for treating retinal dystrophies.	More than 45000 single cells from the developing human retina, ranging from gestational weeks (GW)12-27, and postnatal retina on day 8 were analyzed via single cell RNA-sequencing.

GSE121707	SRP166660	Müller glial cells (MGs) of the zebrafish retina exhibit the remarkable ability to reprogram to proliferative, retinal progenitor-like cells that can regenerate lost photoreceptors and restore vision. Unfortunately, mammalian MGs are not regenerative and this is at least in part due to the inability of MGs to undergo sustained cell cycle re-entry in response to retinal damage. Here, we identify the Hippo pathway as the core regulatory mechanism that normally prevents mammalian MG reprogramming to a proliferative, progenitor-like state. Specifically, in adult MGs within the damaged retina, Hippo signaling represses the activity of the transcription cofactor YAP, which would otherwise promote sustained MG cell cycle re-entry. MG-specific deletion of Hippo pathway components Lats1 and Lats2 resulted in Cyclin D1 upregulation and spontaneous MG proliferation. These data suggest that sustained YAP activity in reactive MGs induces MG proliferation and reprogramming, but this response is normally repressed by the Hippo pathway. Generation of MGs that express a variant of YAP (YAP5SA) that is non-responsive to Hippo signaling, resulted in cellular reprogramming whereby MG identity was lost and the cells acquired a highly proliferative, progenitor-like state.  Together, our results reveal that MGs may have latent regenerative capacity that can be “reawakened” by blocking Hippo signaling.

GSE119343	SRP159286	The macula of the retina has a high ratio of cones to rods and is critical for central vision and visual acuity. Here we report the generation, transcriptome profiling, and functional validation of single cells from cone-enriched human retinal organoids differentiated from hESCs.  Single-cell RNA-seq of 8-month retinal organoids identified clusters of cone and rod photoreceptors and confirmed the cone enrichment initially revealed by immunostaining. Collectively, we have established cone-enriched retinal organoids and a reference of transcriptomes that are rich resources for retinal studies.	To globally characterize the transcriptomes during human retinal cell differentiation, we performed single cell RNA sequencing  of 8M retinal organoids.	NA	NA
GSE112507	SRP136739	Death of photoreceptors and/or Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) cells is a common cause of age related and inherited retinal dystrophies, thus their replenishment from renewable stem cell sources is a well sought therapeutic goal. Human pluripotent stem cells provide a useful cell source in view of their limitless self-renewal capacity and potential to differentiate into all key retinal cell types either in isolation or as part of three dimensional retinal organoids. Photoreceptor precursors have been isolated from differentiating human pluripotent stem cells either through application of cell surface markers or fluorescent reporter approaches and shown to share a transcriptional profile akin to foetal photoreceptors. In this study we investigated the transcriptional profile of CRX+ photoreceptor precursors derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) using single cell RNA sequencing and their engraftment capacity in an animal model of retinitis pigmentosa (C3H/rd1). Single cell RNA seq analysis revealed the presence of dominant cell cluster which displayed the hallmarks of early cone photoreceptor expression. When transplanted subretinally into the C3H/rd1 mice, the Crx positive cells settled next to the inner nuclear layer of host retina, matured into cone photoreceptors and made connections with the inner neurones of the host retina. Cellular transfer between the host retina and donor photoreceptors was investigated and shown to be minimal. Together our data provide valuable molecular insights into the transcriptional profile of human pluripotent stem cells derived CRX+ photoreceptor precursors and indicate their usefulness as a source of transplantable cone photoreceptors.	CRX-GFP human ESC line was differentiated to retinal organoids. At day 90 CRX+ and CRX- cells were purified by flow activated cell sorting and subjected to single cell RNA-seq.

GSE126783	SRP186407	In many forms of retinal degenerative diseases in human, microglia relocate to and accumulate in the subretinal space. However, the roles of microglia in retinal degeneration are poorly understood. By leveraging single cell RNA-seq, we identified a distinct microglia subtype in the subretinal space. These microglia underwent transcriptional reprogramming characterized by reduced expression of homeostatic checkpoint genes and upregulation of injury-responsive genes. Importantly, this transition is associated with protection of the retinal pigment epithelium from damage caused by disease. Therefore, our data demonstrated microglial heterogeneity in retinal degeneration and may provide important implications for developing new strategies to prevent loss of vision.

GSE119893	SRP161678	The rapid improvements in single cell sequencing technologies and analyses methods afford greater scope for dissecting organoid cultures composed of multiple cell types and create an opportunity to interrogate these models to understand tissue biology, cellular behaviour and interactions. To this end, retinal organoids generated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were analysed by single cell RNA-Sequencing at three time points of differentiation. Combinatorial data from all time points revealed the presence of nine clusters, five of which corresponded to key retinal cell types, namely retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), cone and rod photoreceptors and Müller glia cells. The remaining four clusters expressed genes typical of mitotic cells, extracellular matrix (ECM) components and those involved in retinal homeostasis. The cell clustering analysis revealed the decreasing presence of mitotic cells and RGCs, formation of a distinct RPE cluster, the emergence of cone and rod photoreceptors from photoreceptor precursors and an increasing number of Müller Glia cells over time. The pseudotime analysis resembled the order of cell birth during retinal development, with the mitotic cluster commencing the trajectory and the large majority of Müller glia being the latest. Together, these data demonstrate the feasibility and potential of single cell RNA-Seq to dissect the inherent complexity of the organoids and the orderly birth of key retinal cell types.	A hESC (H9) cell line harbouring a CRX-GFP reporter was differentiated to retinal organoids 25.

GSE119320	SRP159246	The mechanisms underlying specification of neuronal subtypes within the human nervous system are largely unknown. The blue/S, green/M and red/L cones of the retina enable high-acuity daytime and color vision. To determine the mechanism controlling S vs. L/M fates, we studied the differentiation of human retinal organoids. Organoids and retinas have similar distributions, expression profiles, and morphologies of cone subtypes. S cones are specified first, followed by L/M cones, and thyroid hormone signaling controls this temporal switch. Dynamic expression of thyroid hormone-degrading and activating proteins within the retina ensures low signaling early to specify S cones and high signaling late to produce L/M cones. This work establishes organoids as a model for determining mechanisms of human development with promising utility for therapeutics and vision repair.	EP1 iPSC-derived organoids were analyzed at time points ranging from day 10 to day 250 of differentiation. We took samples at day 10 (n=3), day 20 (n=2), day 35 (n=3), day 69 (n=3), day 111 (n=3), day 128 (n=3), day 158 (n=2), day 173 (n=3), day 181 (n=3), day 200 (n=3), and day 250 7 (n=3). RNA from individual organoids was extracted using the Zymo Direct-zol RNA Microprep Kit (Zymo Research) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Individual libraries were prepared for each sample using the Illumina TruSeq stranded mRNA kit and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 with single 200 bp reads.

GSE115404	SRP149898	Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) convey the major output of information collected from the eye to the brain. Thirty subtypes of RGCs have been identified to date. Here, we analyze 6,225 RGCs (average of 5,000 genes per cell) from right and left eyes by single cell RNA-seq and classify them into 40 subtypes using clustering algorithms. We identify additional subtypes and markers, as well as transcription factors predicted to cooperate in specifying RGC subtypes. Zic1, a marker of the right eye-enriched subtype, is validated by immunostaining in situ. Runx1 and Fst, the markers of other subtypes, are validated in purified RGCs by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunostaining. We show the extent of gene expression variability needed for subtype segregation, and we show a hierarchy in diversification from a cell type population to subtypes. Finally, we present a website for comparing the gene expression of RGC subtypes.

GSE107618	SRP125998	The developmental pathway of the neural retina (NR) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) has been revealed by extensive research in mice. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of the human NR and RPE, as well as the interactions between these two tissues, have not been well defined. Here, we analyzed 2,421 individual cells from human fetal NR and RPE using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technique and revealed the tightly regulated spatiotemporal gene expression network of human retinal cells. We identified major cell classes of human fetal retina and potential crucial transcription factors for each cell class. We dissected the dynamic expression patterns of visual cycle and ligand-receptor interaction related genes in the RPE and NR. Moreover, we provided a map of disease-related genes for human fetal retinal cells and highlighted the importance of retinal progenitor cells as potential targets of inherited retinal diseases. Our findings captured the key in vivo features of the development of the human NR and RPE and offered insightful clues for further functional studies.

GSE125708	SRP182592	The mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is capable of tolerating chronic hypoxia, but cell type-specific responses to this stress have not been systematically characterized.  In the Norrin-knockout (NdpKO) mouse, a model of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), developmental hypovascularization of the retina produces chronic hypoxia of inner nuclear layer (INL) neurons and Muller glia.  We have used single-cell RNA sequencing, untargeted metabolomics, and metabolite labeling from 13C-glucose to compare wild type and NdpKO retinas.  In NdpKO retinas, we observe gene expression responses consistent with hypoxia in Muller glia and retinal neurons, and we find a metabolic shift that combines reduced flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle with increased synthesis of serine, glycine, and glutathione.  We also used single-cell RNA sequencing to compare the responses of individual cell types in NdpKO retinas to those in the hypoxic cerebral cortex of mice that were housed for one week in a reduced oxygen environment (7.5% oxygen).  In the hypoxic cerebral cortex, glial transcriptome responses most closely resemble the response of Muller glia in the NdpKO retina.  In both retina and brain, vascular endothelial cells activate a previously dormant tip cell gene expression program, which likely underlies the adaptive neo-angiogenic response to chronic hypoxia.  These analyses of retina and brain transcriptomes at single-cell resolution reveal both shared and cell-type-specific changes in gene expression in response to chronic hypoxia, implying both shared and distinct cell type-specific physiologic responses.

GSE142526	SRP238587	To study the development of human retina, we used single cell RNAseq at key fetal stages and followed the development of the major cell types, as well as populations of transitional cells. We also analyzed stem cell (hPSC)-derived retinal organoids; although organoids have a very similar cellular composition at equivalent ages to the fetal retina, there are some differences in gene expression of particular cell types. Moreover, the inner retinal lamination is disrupted in more advanced stages of organoids when compared with fetal retina. To determine whether the disorganization in the inner retina was due to the culture conditions, we analyzed retinal development in fetal retina maintained under similar conditions. These retinospheres develop for at least 6 months, displaying better inner retinal lamination than retinal organoids. Our scRNAseq comparisons between fetal retina, retinal organoids and retinospheres provide a new resource for developing better in vitro models for retinal disease.

GSE149100	SRP257883	Purpose: The goals of this study were to identify cell specific expression patterns from infant and aged choroid, with a particular emphasis on how endothelial gene expression changes with age. Methods: Independent libraries were prepared for infant and adult choroidal cells from four human donors. Macular and peripheral samples from single-cell donors 18-21 were acquired, analyzed, and uploaded in a previous experiment (GSE135922). In single-cell donors 22-25, new reads were acquired from a 12-mm macula-centered punch. Choroidal punches gently dissociated in collagenase II for 1 hours before cryopreservation. Thawed cells were enriched endothelial cells by incubating with anti-CD31-microbeads. Both CD31-positive and CD31-negative libraries from single-cell donors 22-25 were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq system. Sequenced reads were mapped to the human genome build hg19 with CellRanger(v3.0.1) and filtered to remove cells likely to be doublets or cells with a high proportion of mitochondrial reads. Libraries from single-cell donors 22-25 were aggregated with donors 18-21 using canonical correlation analysis. Feature selection was performed with the variance stabilizing transformation before integration was performed with Seurat (v3.0.1). Results: A total of 37,070 cells were recovered after filtering with 415,740,738 corresponding reads. A total of 17,229 cells were recovered from infant libraries while 19,841 cells were recovered from the adult libraries. Clusters were assigned to known choroidal cell types based on expression of distinguishing marker genes. Differential expression analysis identified genes enriched in each population of cells originating from infant versus adult libraries. Particular emphasis was given to genes enriched in infant choriocapillaris endothelial cells. Conclusions: This study provides a transcriptomic comparison of infant and aged human donor choroid at the bulk and single-cell levels. The aged choroid, in particular the aged vasculature, is enriched in pro-inflammatory genes.	mRNA profiles for thousands of cells from infant and adult choroidal isolates were generated from four donor eyes (single-cell donors 22-25) using 10X Genomics Chromium single-cell system followed by sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq.

To identify expression programs associated with differential resilience, we first used single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to generate a comprehensive molecular atlas of 45 RGC types in adult retina. We tracked their survival after ONC, characterized transcriptomic, morphological, and physiological changes that preceded degeneration, and identified genes selectively expressed by each type. Finally, loss- and gain-of-function assays in vivo showed that manipulating some of these genes improved neuronal survival and axon regeneration following ONC. This study provides a systematic framework for parsing type-specific responses to injury, and demonstrates that these responses can be used to reveal molecular targets for intervention	In this experiment, we FACS sorted for retinal ganglion cells using a combination of a transgenic reporter (VGLUT2) and a surface protein CD90 from dissociated cells from retinas of adult (postnatal day 56) mice	Tran NM, Shekhar K, Whitney IE, Jacobi A et al.

E-MTAB-7316	E-MTAB-7316	To comprehensively profile cell types in the human retina, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing on 20,009 cells obtained post-mortem from three donors and compiled a reference transcriptome atlas. Using unsupervised clustering analysis, we identified 18 transcriptionally distinct clusters representing all known retinal cells: rod photoreceptors, cone photoreceptors, Müller glia cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, retinal ganglion cells, horizontal cells, retinal astrocytes and microglia.

GSE135922	SRP218652	The goals of this study were to identify cell specific expression patterns of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and a variety of choroidal cell types originating from the macula and the periphery of human donor eyes, with a particular emphasis on identifying expression signatures of choroidal endothelial cells.	mRNA profiles for thousands of cells from macular and peripheral RPE/choroid isolates were generated from seven human donor eyes using 10X Genomics Chromium single-cell system followed by sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 4000.

GSE148077	SRP255195	Most irreversible blindness results from retinal disease. To advance our understanding of the etiology of blinding diseases, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the transcriptomes of ~85,000 cells from the fovea and peripheral reti-na of seven adult human donors. Utilizing computational methods, we identified 58 cell types within 6 classes: photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, retinal gangli-on and non-neuronal cells. Nearly all types are shared between the two retinal re-gions, but there are notable differences in gene expression and proportions between foveal and peripheral cohorts of shared types. We then used the human retinal atlas to map expression of 636 genes implicated as causes of or risk factors for blinding dis-eases. Many are expressed in striking cell class-, type-, or region-specific patterns. Fi-nally, we compared gene expression signatures of cell types between human and the cynomolgus macaque monkey, Macaca fascicularis. We show that over 90% of human types correspond transcriptomically to those previously identified in macaque, and that expression of disease-related genes is largely conserved between the two species. These results validate the use of the macaque for modeling blinding disease, and pro-vide a foundation for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying visual pro-cessing.	To generate a comprehensive cell atlas of human retina, we obtained eight retinas from seven genetically unrelated human donors with no clinical history of ocular disease. We dissected fovea (~1.5 mm diameter centered on the foveal pit, which was visible under a dissecting microscope) and peripheral samples (> 5 mm from the fovea) from whole retina, pooling peripheral pieces from all four quadrants. Foveal samples were dissociated into single cells, which were profiled without further processing using high-throughput droplet sequencing. For peripheral samples, in which rod photoreceptors and RGC comprise ~80% and <2 % of total cells respectively, we depleted rods using magnetic beads conjugated to anti-CD73 or enriched RGCs using anti-CD90-conjugated beads prior to collection , using protocols established in our study on macaque retina.
